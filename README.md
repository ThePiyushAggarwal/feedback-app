This is a project from a course by Brad Traversy

Netlify website is there: https://pedantic-almeida-052c06.netlify.app/

But it is not fully functional because of JSON server is not configured properly in the build.

Though this project will work on your machine locally.

USE npm run dev to start the server as well the app in localhost server.
